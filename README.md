# Template

Compendium template for all projects ever to submit anywhere. 

It's a R package, with sweave files, datas, vignettes for packages and all stuff to write down great work from Rstudio.

## To do : 

- create different styles for sweave
- clean the latex template
- add twocolumn example
- add .bst files to set natbib fine
- expose a correct sweave for saving .RData (see Markov file
- change color of links
- put some boolean to quick set packages and all
- add bluebox env.
- maybe input files for different title styles.
- add Stangle to tryhard script


Feel free to fork this, and use it. Any recommendation is welcome :)
