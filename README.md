# Template

Compendium template for all projects ever to submit anywhere. 

It's a R package, with sweave files, datas, vignettes for packages and all stuff to write down great work from Rstudio.

## To do : 

- create different styles for sweave
- clean the latex template


Feel free to fork this, and use it. Any recommendation is welcome :)
